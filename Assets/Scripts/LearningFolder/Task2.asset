  question: The distance from Euler to a car is 0m after 0s, 11m after 0.5s, 11m
    after 3s, and 0m after 3.5s. What's the average speed from 0s to 0.5s, 0.5s to
    2.5s, and 2.5s to 3s?
  answer1: 22m/s, 0m/s, and -22m/s
  ans1MathDialog:
    guidance: Amazing!
    AnimationClip: {fileID: 0}
  answer2: 20m/s, 10m/s, and -20m/s
  ans2MathDialog:
    guidance: Have you chosen the right starts and stops?
